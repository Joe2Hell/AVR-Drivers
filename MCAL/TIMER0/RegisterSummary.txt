    1       1       Set OC0 on compare match when up-counting. Clear OC0 on compare match when downcounting



    x- Bit 7 Force output compare is used to force an immediate compare match (generating an output compare event) when set.
    	FOC0 must be Zero when no PWM mode is select



2- TCNT0 (Timer/Counter Register 0) 

    x- Timer/Counter Register 0  stores the current value of the Timer/Counter 0.
    x- Whenever Timer/Counter 0 is running, it increments its value continuously, based on the clock source and prescaler settings configured in TCCR0.
    x- The range of TCNT0 is from 0 to 255 (for 8-bit mode), after which it overflows and restarts from 0.  (Total 256 ticks)
    x- If set to 200, timer will start counting from 200 till reaching 255
    

3- OCR0 (Output compare  register)    

    x- It is used primarily in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) mode or in Compare Match mode to set the compare value against which the TCNT0 (Timer/Counter Register 0) is compared.
    x- When TCNT0 matches the value stored in OCR0, specific actions can occur depending on the configuration of Timer/Counter 0.
    x- In PWM mode, OCR0 determines the duty cycle of the PWM waveform generated on the OC0 pin.
    x- In Compare Match mode, the match between TCNT0 and OCR0 can trigger actions like toggling, setting, or clearing the OC0 pin.
    x- Writing a value to OCR0 sets the compare value, and the comparison occurs continuously as TCNT0 increments.


4- TIMSK (Timer/Counter Interrupt Mask Register)   

    x- TIMSK controls the generation of interrupts related to Timer/Counter operations.
    x- It allows you to enable or disable specific interrupts associated with Timer/Counter modules
    x- we are only concerned with Bit 0  and bit 1           
                                  TOIE0      OCIE0   
    x- TOIE0 (Timer/Counter0 Overflow Interrupt Enable): When this bit is set (1), it enables the interrupt triggered by the overflow of Timer/Counter 0 (when TCNT0 rolls over from 255 to 0).
    x- OCIE0 (Output Compare Match Interrupt Enable): When this bit is set (1), it enables the interrupt triggered by a compare match between TCNT0 and OCR0.
    x- Read and Write


5- TIFR (Timer/Counter Interrupt Flag Register)   

    x- TIFR stores flags indicating the status of various Timer/Counter-related interrupt conditions.
    x- It is used in conjunction with TIMSK (Timer/Counter Interrupt Mask Register) to manage interrupts related to Timer/Counter operations.
    x- we are only concerned with Bit 0  and bit 1           
                                  TOV0       OCF0   
    x- TOV0 (Timer/Counter0 Overflow Flag): This flag is set (1) when Timer/Counter 0 overflows, i.e., when TCNT0 rolls over from its maximum value to 0.
    x- OCF0 (Output Compare Match Flag): This flag is set (1) when a compare match occurs between TCNT0 and OCR0.
    x- Reading the TIFR register allows you to check the status of specific interrupt flags to determine if particular events have occurred.
    x- Read and Write

6- SFIOR (Special Function Input Output Register)   

    x- a special-purpose register that contains control bits for various functions related to the operation of the microcontroller.
    x- we are only concerned with Bit 0
                                  PSR10
    x- When this bit is written to one, the Timer/Counter1 and Timer/Counter0 prescaler will be reset.
    x- Read and Write


Normal mode calculation :

Tick time = Prescaler / Frequency of system (Clock)

Time for one overflow = Tick time x total ticks  = Tick time x 2^n     where n is the bit size of timer,  here it could be 8 bits or 10 bits  (256 or 1024 ticks)


No. of overflows required = Required time / Time for one overflow

say if it equals   4882.8215   
                    //   \\
                   //     \\
                  OK       Problem, we dont like decimals at all
                            To solve this issue, we insert it into this equation
                            Preload = 2^n (1 - 0.y)   where y is the decimal  in our case its 0.8215
                            it should return a whole integer with no decimals, if there is still a decimal , then there is nothing we can do about
                            this will have to suffice
            then we insert that preload into the TCNT0 at the start of each whole cycle 
            and dont forget to place the counter in our ISR to equal 4882 + 1   so 4883, we round the digit upwards at all times
